# simple-admin-app
This is a simple bootstrap and meteor project for admin panel, containing login and some examples of charts.

To run just download the source code, install meteor and after going to the source code directory run the command:

`meteor`

Afterwards just open localhost:3000 in your browser.

Login and registration works, however doesn't display messages on failed attempts.
